/*
Why do we use the word “debugger” in javascript?
*/

/*

The word debugger is used to pause the execution of the script at a specific point.
It helps in knowing the state of application at a specific point like knowing the value of variables or analysing the call stack and scope.

It helps in quick debugging, placing the word debugger is faster than navigating through the debugging tools to set a breakpoint.
