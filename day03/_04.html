<!-- 
Explain about Debouncing in Javascript. 
-->



<!-- 
Debouncing is basically a concept that is used to tackle a problem of unnecessary function calls.

For Ex:-
When we go to the flipkart website and we search product in the the search bar, So the function call is made when
we stop typing. The function call is made after few milliseconds depending upon the business requirement.

if we search laptop
then only function call is made, after typing the whole word laptop i.e. when we stop typing.
No function calls are made till we continuously type letters l,a,p,t,o
we stop on p letter, so then the function call is made.

This implementation prevents getData from being called too frequently while the user is typing, reducing
unnecessary function calls and potential data fetching operations.
